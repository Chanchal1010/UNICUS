## 📝Description

UNICUS = UNIQUE US 
Our Application aims to bridge the gap between them and the physical world by leveraging the power of Deep Learning which can be made accessible even on low-ended devices with a lucid User-Interface that would allow them to better understand the world around them.
This app is one stop educational platform for the physically challenged people , where through the different mediums they can communicate with us and also educate themselves in better way. Starting from the  basics is very important so  we have included An assistance to deaf/mute people to communicate with others who are not even aware of Sign Language and also we have included voice to text converter for them so that they can easily survive in the surrounding
This was an enriching experience for all of us that are part of this team.

## Special features

1 We have used a minimum number of buttons, but whatever buttons are there, are of a large size.   For instance, the top half of the screen will have one button, and the bottom half, another button, so that a user does not need to precisely click on a particular position in order to be easy for blind people to navigate the application ?

2 All features work in -time and do not require any preprocessing time for the models to make predictions, so the user can get instant updates ?
